# Spiekermann

Spiekermann is a bold WordPress block theme for blogs and portfolios, featuring an asymmetrical grid layout on the front page. Inspired by brutalist design, it uses a quirky pixelated sans-serif font and emphasizes raw aesthetics, unconventional layouts, and typographic focus. It includes ten different color schemes and three different typographic styles to choose from. Demo: https://spiekermann.andersnoren.se
